# Build instructions
Just type make, or read Makefile (RTFM) for other configurations.

Not recommended to install (since it is not complete by all means) so there is no install instructions.

# Coding style
I try to follow linux kernel coding style as strictly as possible, so if you're gonna contribute follow the style:
https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.10/process/coding-style.html

# TODOS:
- ~Fix parsing (ls -a looks for ' -a' dir)~ -> Fix too ugly
- Read env vars, PATH etc.
- ~pipe~, redirect out
- cd and other shell commands
- Keyboard inputs etc.
- Check memleaks
- Docs (In the very distant future)
