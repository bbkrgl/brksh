# Build instructions
Just type make, or read Makefile (RTFM) for other configurations.

Not recommended to install (since it is not complete by all means) so there is no install instructions.

# TODOS:
- Read env vars, PATH etc.
- pipe, redirect out
- cd and other shell commands
- Docs (In the very distant future)
